        <p class="statement">   
            “A system may be defined as a set of elements standing in interrelation among themselves and with environment.” <br>– Ludwig von Bertalanffy, <i>General System Theory</i> (1998)<br><br>

            “We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done.” <br>– Jack Burnham, <i>Systems Esthetics</i> (1968)<br><br>
            
Influenced by systems thinking and art in the 1960s, I explore how artworks can exist in a systemic form, and how that prompts the formation of interdependent relationships between people and their surroundings. I primarily use technology as a method of exploration and expression, and continuously attempt to discover ways in which it can be used to connect people, objects, and environments. Alongside this, I am interested in how artworks might be produced through implementing systemic and processual methods, and am particularly interested in generative drawing and data visualisation.<br><br>
My artworks most commonly exist in the form of large-scale installation. These installations involve collecting data from the viewer and surrounding environment, transforming it in some way, and feeding it back - usually in a visual manner. Through this, an interdependence between material/technical components, the environment, and the viewer is created. This interdependence opens up questions surrounding the role of the viewer, and where artistic value is located in contemporary art today – as well as prompting questions surrounding the presence of systems and technology in culture today.
