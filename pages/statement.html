        <!--<h2>Statement</h2>-->
        <p class="statement">“A system may be defined as a set of elements standing in interrelation among themselves and with environment.” – Ludwig von Bertalanffy, <i>General System Theory</i> (1998)<br><br>
        “We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done.” – Jack Burnham, <i>Systems Esthetics</i> (1968)<br><br>
            
        My practice is research-based and experimental, and uses technology as both a method of exploration and expression. Exploring the idea of the system as artwork, large-scale results usually take the form of interactive installations which form systems by incorporating the viewer and elements of the surrounding environment as components. In 1968, art writer Jack Burnham claimed that a systems approach to aesthetics would become dominant, and it would seem that Burnham’s prophecy was not far off the mark. A systems approach not only to aesthetics but to everything is so embedded in culture today, through the presence of advanced technologies and the internet, that it is simply part of who we are and how we live. The intention of my installations is to demonstrate this through assembling systems - an interdependence between material/technical components, environment, and viewer, is created in such a way that they rely upon each other for the artwork to exist in its whole form. This interdependence opens up questions surrounding the role of the viewer, and where artistic value is actually located in contemporary art today – as well as prompting questions surrounding the presence of systems and technology in everyday life.<br>
        <br>
        Within this heavily research-based element of my practice, I also undertake small scale experimental projects which explore systemic and processual methods in a more contained manner. Projects that are currently ongoing explore generative drawing through both traditional and technological mediums, the capabilities of the Microsoft Kinect to create varying levels of interactivity in environments, and how varying forms of data can be captured and visualised using Arduino and Processing.<br>
